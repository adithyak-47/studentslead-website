      <p>Life that you and me are living is almost the same even if we might have had a different past. I was a girl who was kinda cool in her on world. Mornings, even if it rained, I used to reach the location on time to catch my college bus.</p>
<p>Then I would meet my collegues and my seniors. We would have a chit chat. Sometimes, loud laughter or small giggles. I felt really comfortable.</p>
<p>And then the bus comes. I get to greet all those smiling faces. After I secure my seat, I would reach out for my company. We would have a talk - on the silliest things below the sun. Maybe our looks. Maybe on some post that recently appeared on social media. And sometimes this would be so noisy that the entire bus would suddenly go into a state of pin drop silence and the whole focus would shift to our giggles..!</p>
<p>Well, even though that was uncomfortably awkward, I loved it as I felt really energetic for the whole day! We often play songs in our college bus. It gave me a different ambience. It helped me to spend a bit of time with myself, it gave me time for self introspection..</p>
<p>When the bus enters the arch of the college, entirely a different mood would set off. Now I would be fully occupied with the schedule - classes, labs, record works, placement trainings, assignments, tutorials, interactive sessions..</p>
<p>I was really busy and I took them seriously..</p>
<p>I realized that learning is fun when you have a flock to fly with. My friends with whom I consult anything to everything.. Cool corridor walks.. Trying a new snack @ caffeteria.. kioski.. (The most confusing part- the way to reach an open reprography..!)</p>
<p>I have endless fun in my class. Endless fights and endless patchups with my bestie! (We fight a lot. But end of the day, we are always there for each other)</p>
<p>Then comes academics.. Classes with rapid fires.. Series tests.. Exams.. What not?</p>
<p>After a day of ups and downs, I&rsquo;m back to my bus - fighting for the window seat. I gaze down to the moving air, to everything that leaves behind. I feel a sense of unhappiness - another day of my carefree life is done, another day of my fun life is gone.. Slowly I get lost in my thoughts until I fall asleep..</p>
<p>Suddenly one of my friends would shook me, she wants me to get off..! (I really don&rsquo;t know how time goes when I take a nap in the bus after the whole day) Waving a tata and byebye to my friends, I get down the bus with others.</p>
<p>The best part that I miss so much is.. My li&rsquo;l shoppings.. My li&rsquo;l cravings.. And my way back to home..</p>
<p>And that is me. This is my world - my world where I am a super cool girl.. I seriously hope for the remaining few days of my carefree college life to be filled with same ease and content.</p>
