          Life that you and me are living is almost the same even if we might have had a different past. I was a girl who was kinda cool in her on world. Mornings, even if it rained, I used to reach the location on time to catch my college bus.
Then I would meet my collegues and my seniors. We would have a chit chat. Sometimes, loud laughter or small giggles.

          Itâ€™s a bliss to be surrounded by people whom you love.
How irritating would it be to get messages all day long (why wouldnâ€™t the other person just stop texting?) and then all of a sudden someone (whom you might have studied with) calls you, goes on to speak for an hour â€“ on various matters that you are least interested in and somehow at some point of time you run out of topic, you expect a halt, but your friend would never stop, adds a couple of his other friends to the line, speaks for yet another hour on what the ruling party has done to the country â€“ ah, a classic topic to discuss!
